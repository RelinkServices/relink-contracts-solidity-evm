# Relink - Trustless Chainlink Relaying Service

Relink empowers new blockchains, or those with less focus, to access established services on the major chains.

Chainlink itself supports only a few chains at all. At the same time, the speed at which new chains are deployed is constantly increasing. Be it as L2s or even L3s or as another competitive L1s.

Relink has developed a proxy service solution that forwards the random data request to an officially from Chainlink supported chain and processes the result accordingly.

A Relink oracle network signs the data generated by Chainlink and passes the original data along with the signatures to the callback method. The signature checks in the consumer base contract mean that no data can be changed on the way from the relaying backend.

## Getting Started

### Configuration

Relink Proxy Addresses:

- Horizen EON Mainnet: `0xC8e11C15cf94a456209B7AbF110481Eb86B50C0c`
- Horizen Gobi Testnet: `0x5f1bf0fDCCE9fA05CeBFf3071F1573fDb2C68206`

Relink Oracle Addresses for Signature Verification:

- 0x3D5b65E984D7D3a346B8d5065Cd8b3ACA8032013
- 0x08A9aF3408cE11f336eAd8336a3Fd959AbB917E8
- 0xf4Bb2ae87C61b4a1EaADf5e6809DFb8801E22f58

### Prerequisite

1. Copy `.env.example` and name the file `.env`
2. Set environment variables accordingly
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npx hardhat clean`
5. Run `npx hardhat compile`

### Deploy Consumer Example

`npx hardhat deploy.consumer.example 0x3D5b65E984D7D3a346B8d5065Cd8b3ACA8032013 0x08A9aF3408cE11f336eAd8336a3Fd959AbB917E8 0xf4Bb2ae87C61b4a1EaADf5e6809DFb8801E22f58 --network proxyMainnet --proxy 0xC8e11C15cf94a456209B7AbF110481Eb86B50C0c --threshold 2`

### Initiate Consumer Example Randomness Request

`npx hardhat --network proxyMainnet init.consumer.request --addr 0x05dd9422DEe32c9046Cd1cf17832299fF9CE5B1f`
